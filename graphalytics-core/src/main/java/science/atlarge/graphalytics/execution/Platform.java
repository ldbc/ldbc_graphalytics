/**
 * The common interface for any platform that implements the Graphalytics benchmark suite. It
 * defines the API that must be provided by a platform to be compatible with the Graphalytics
 * benchmark driver. The driver uses the {@link #uploadGraph(FormattedGraph) uploadGraph} and
 * {@link #deleteGraph(FormattedGraph) deleteGraph} functions to ensure the right graphs are loaded,
 * and uses {@link #execute(BenchmarkRun) executeAlgorithmOnGraph}
 * to trigger the executing of various algorithms on each graph.
 * <p>
 * Note: it is highly recommended for platform implementations to extend {@link AbstractPlatform}
 * instead of implementing the Platform interface. As Graphalytics evolves, this interface may
 * be extended with additional (optional) methods.
