    A Big Data Benchmark For Graph-Processing Platforms
</p>

Graph processing is of increasing interest for many scientific areas and revenue-generating applications, such as social networking, bioinformatics, online retail, and online gaming. To address the growing diversity of graph datasets and graph-processing algorithms, developers and system integrators have created a large variety of graph-processing platforms, which we define as the combined hardware, software, and programming system that is being used to complete a graph processing task. **LDBC Graphalytics**, an industrial-grade benchmark under [LDBC](https://ldbcouncil.org), is developed to enable objective comparisons between graph processing platforms by using six representative graph algorithms, and a large variety of real-world and synthetic datasets. Visit [our website](https://ldbcouncil.org/benchmarks/graphalytics/) for the most recent updates of the Graphalytics project.

### Publication
Want to know more about Graphalytics? Read [our VLDB paper](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol9/p1317-iosup.pdf) and the [specification](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics_docs).

### Build & Run your first benchmark
Graphalytics provides [a list of platform drivers](https://graphalytics.org/software) for the state-of-the-arts graph processing platforms. To start your first benchmark with Graphalytics, download the benchmark software from our repository and follow the detailed instructions in the manual on [Building the Software](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics/wiki/Documentation%3A-Software-Build) and [Running a Benchmark](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics/wiki/Manual:-Running-Benchmark). Our datasets are [hosted publicly](datasets.md)


### Add your platform
Do you want to study and compare the performance of your newly developed platform? The Graphalytics benchmark suite can be easily extended by developed a platform driver for your own platform, built upon the platform driver template. Follow the detailed instructions in the manual on [Implementing Driver](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics/wiki/Manual:-Implementing-Driver).

### Participate in competitions
LDBC Graphalytics hosts bi-annual competitions for graph processing platforms. Are you interested in the state-of-the-art performance? View the competition results of previous editions in [our website](https://graphalytics.org/competition). Do you want to impress others with the excellent performance of your platform? Follow the detailed instructions in the manual on [submitting your benchmark results](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics/wiki/Manual%3A-Submitting-Result).
