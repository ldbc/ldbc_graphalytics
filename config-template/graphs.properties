# Directory to cache derived datasets in (optional, defaults to ${graphs.root-directory}/cache)
# During execution, Graphalytics will create additional graphs from source datasets with subsets of properties,
# e.g. given a graph with edge weights, Graphalytics will write an edge list to disk without weights to run BFS on.
# Cached datasets are reused by Graphalytics between invocations to speed up the benchmarking process.
